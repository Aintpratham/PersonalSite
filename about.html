        <h2>Hey there — I’m Pratham Shah</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to my corner of the internet — the one place where I can talk to myself and call it “content.”
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m Pratham Shah — part-time tech enthusiast, full-time overthinker, and a guy who treats debugging like boss battles.
            I’m currently diving headfirst into the world of computer programming and analysis at Fanshawe College, learning how to speak fluent code and occasionally scream at it too.
            These days, I work in the Omni department at Walmart — basically the Jesse Pinkman of online orders:
            “Yo, Mr. White, I got the cereal and the slippers!” I spend my shifts racing the clock to pick and hand off orders like it’s a secret mission.
            When I’m off the clock, you’ll find me at the gym training like winter is coming — because I refuse to be the background character who skips leg day and dies five minutes into the battle.
        </p>
        <p>
            Oh, and if you ever see someone named <strong>Bunny</strong> picking up Tims/Starbucks or ordering an Uber — that’s me.
            I started using it as a joke inspired by a Bollywood character I love, but now it’s kind of stuck.
            It’s easier to pronounce, sounds fun, and honestly? I don’t hate the vibe.
          </p>
        <p>
            This blog is my digital playground — a mix of dev logs, personal rants, life lessons,
            and maybe a conspiracy theory or two (just kidding… or am I?). Expect chaos, caffeine, and code.
        </p>
        <p><strong>What you’ll find here:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>🎓Real talk about student life, time management, and near-burnouts</li>
          <li>🛠️ My projects — the good, the bad, and the ones I gave up on at 2AM</li>
          <li>🧠  Deep thoughts, occasional rants, and probably a meme or three</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            My goal? Keep learning, stay curious, and build something cool — 
            even if it breaks five times first. If you're into that vibe, you’re in the right place.
        </p>
        <p><em>Thanks for reading this far. Let’s grow together.</em><br>— Pratham</p>
