# Intro

Easily distracted by cool ideas, dangerously obsessed with finishing them.

I build bots at 3AM, break things to learn faster, and occasionally ship stuff that actually works. My brain flips between “this should exist” and “I could totally make that” about twenty times a day — and sometimes, I do.

Currently turning coffee into code (and co-op applications) at [Fanshawe College](https://www.fanshawec.ca/), where I'm studying **Computer Programming and Analysis**.

Fluent in **Python**, **C++**, **Java**, and sarcasm. I tinker with Android apps, Discord bots, personal blogs, and startup ideas — if it lets me mix creativity with code, I’m in.

When I’m not writing code, I’m probably:
- Watching reruns of **FRIENDS**, **Breaking Bad**, or **TMKOC**
- Getting lost in open worlds like **GTA V**, **RDR2**, or **HITMAN : WOA**
- Starting side projects I promise I’ll finish “this time”

This isn’t a polished portfolio. It’s a sandbox — where half the ideas break, and the other half try to rule.  
Because in the game of code, you ship — or you fix logs until 3AM.

# History

- working on it...


# I Like

- Working out  
- Photography  
- Old Hindi Songs (90's Bolloywood)
- Exploring new places (or at least the local park)  
- Keeping up with the latest in phone and gadget tech  
- Summer and sunsets
- Building bots that break the moment they work  
- Gaming (Hitman and RDR2 — forever in rotation)  
- Rewatching scenes from Peaky Blinders for motivation  
- Clean code (but only after writing messy code first)  
- Debugging at 3AM (with snacks)  
- That first cup of coffee when the project actually runs  

# Travel / Geography

- I’m originally from Mehsana, Gujarat (India), and moved to Canada in September 2023. I’ve been living in London, Ontario since.
- On my way here, I had a 21-hour layover in Dubai — so yes, technically, that counts as a second country visited.
- Other than that? Just India and Canada for now. But the list’s gotta start somewhere, right?
- I do have a growing Google Maps wishlist of places I want to explore — someday when time, money, and visas align.
- Some of the places on my wishlist - Los Angeles, Paris, Hongkong, Tokyo, Seoul.

# Fun Facts

- I talk way too much for someone who writes code for hours in silence.
- I have watched FRIENDS 8-times. YES 8-times.
- My favorite debugging tool is taking a walk and yelling “why though?!”
- Gym at 8AM after a night shift? Yes. Social event at 8PM? Too late, I’m in bed.
- I judge a game’s quality by how lost I get in it (RDR2 has seen me at my best and worst).
- Unboxing videos are my Netflix. Specs are my spoilers.
- I’ll take a good brainstorm session over small talk any day.
- “One more episode” has turned into entire seasons more times than I’d like to admit.
- I lift weights to stay sane and write code to stay curious.
- If caffeine ever disappears, I’m starting a rebellion.
- I genuinely think debugging is 80% emotional support and 20% logic.

# I Dream Of

- Building things that make people’s lives a little easier or a lot more interesting.  
- Turning ideas into products — even the weird ones that start at 2AM.  
- Writing code that’s clean enough not to scare future me.  
- Doing work I’m proud of, surrounded by people who push me to get better.  
- Staying hungry to learn, no matter where I end up.  
- Making enough impact to matter — even if it's in small, unexpected ways.  
- Looking back someday and thinking, “yeah, that was worth it.”  
- Not regretting what I didn’t start.  
- Coming back to this list later and adding something wild after it happens.
